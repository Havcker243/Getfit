### Aim

Driven by a passion for fitness, I identified a barrier many face: initiating their gym journey due to lack of knowledge or intimidation. "Virtual Gym Journey" is designed to tackle these challenges head-on, empowering individuals not only to visit the gym but also to prioritize their overall health.

### Function

This platform serves as a virtual gym assistant, offering:

1. **Nutritional Guidance** : Users can access tailored food resources based on personal parameters like weight, height, gender, and age.
2. **Personalized Meal Plans** : After collecting user specifics via a form, the platform crafts a diet plan tailored to individual needs.
3. **Exercise Regimens** : Users receive workout suggestions targeting specific body parts they wish to focus on.
4. **Inspiration from Pros** : Three major bodybuilders' workout routines are highlighted to inspire and motivate users.
5. **Bonus Music Links** : As an added perk, the platform offers Spotify links to curated workout tracks, enhancing the overall gym experience.

### Description

The website encompasses five main sections:

1. **Home Page** : A welcoming space for users, introducing them to the platform.
2. **Goals** : Outlines the mission, vision, and objectives of the virtual gym while also offering guidance on navigating and utilizing the platform.
3. **Meal Builder** : An interactive page gathering user details, such as age, height, gender, dietary preferences, etc. Post submission, users receive a custom meal plan aligning with their inputs.
4. **Workout Plans** : This segment prompts users to input personal information, followed by a custom-tailored workout routine. This page also serves as a hub for external resources, motivational videos, and Spotify workout playlists.
5. **Contact Us Page** : An avenue for users to join the platform's mailing list, ensuring they're updated with newsletters and other vital information.

### Progress

1. Enhancing visual elements for seamless browsing across phones, laptops, and iPads.
2. Migrating the codebase to React to enrich user interactivity.
3. Developing a Python script to interface with ChatGPT. The goal is to recommend optimum workouts and meal plans based on user inputs.

### Future Plans

1. Expansion with more web pages catering to a broader array of fitness needs.
2. Ensuring website responsiveness across varied devices for a flawless user experience.
